# Streaming Media in Laravel
*By Anya Zinoveva*

In 2020, the [laravel-video](https://github.com/imanghafoori1/laravel-video) package was released by imanghafoori1.  There are no comments yet. I looks like the package is using HTML 5 player.  
Further Questions: 
- Is it smart enough to select the media source based on the bandwidth/file type/file size? Will it require an integration with a video player? if so, what is the best player option?
- Will it work with Amazon streaming server?  Here is the post that descrives the [Amazon S3 streaming issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46363623/laravel-s3-retreiving-a-video-to-stream).  Is there an alternative Amazon streaming server?

Prior attempts to develop media  in Laravel reference issues with playback, in perticular with Google Chrome.  imanghafoori1 seems to fix this problem in the latest release,  v2.0.2
