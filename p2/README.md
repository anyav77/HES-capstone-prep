## Notes for instructor
Ultimately, I would like to combine the price and product title in a dropdown format.  The information will be pulled from the database. I'm also planning to incorporate a graph, to represent sales trends/best performing products.
The current version functions as an estimator / prototype:  I adjusted the design to align it with the requirements of the assignment.
